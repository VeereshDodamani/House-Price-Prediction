**Building an End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Price Prediction using "ZenML" and "MLflow"**

This project is focused on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for house price prediction system.
The pipeline is developed using ZenML, a MLOps framework that helps in managing machine learning workflows, and MLflow, which is used for experiment tracking and model deployment.
The primary goal is to predict house prices based on various features of the properties, such as the size, location, and condition.

But everyone is doing house price prediction system, **HOW it will differentiate ME?**

**What Most People Do?**
1. Limited Exploration:
    1. Most practitioners start with basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using standard frameworks.
    2. They quickly move on to calling. Fit on a model without thoroughly understanding the data.
2. Basic Model Training:
    1. After EDA, they typically split the data, train a model, and call predict.
    2. The project often ends here with a focus on achieving high accuracy or minimizing error.
3. Lack of Iteration:
    1. Once the model is trained, it's rarely revisited or improved based on deeper insights from the data.
    2. There's minimal or no effort in validating assumptions or handling model violations.

**My Comprehensive Approach**
1. Thorough Data Research:
    1. Most practitioners start with basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using standard frameworks.
    2. They quickly move on to calling fit on a model without thoroughly understanding the data.
2. Structured Data Processing:
    1. Implement findings from EDA in the preprocessing stage, ensuring the data is clean and feature-engineered to maximize model         
       performance.
    2. Continuously validate and correct assumptions during model training, fixing any violations through iterative improvement.
3. Beyond Core ML:
    1. I don't just train a model; I will ensure it meets all necessary assumptions and refine it iteratively.
    2. I focus on building a robust pipeline that can be easily reproduced and deployed.
4. MLOps and Production Readiness:
    1. Differentiate our project by integrating MLOps practices using ZenML and MLflow.
    2. Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, deployment, of the model in production.
    3. Ensure the model is not only accurate but also maintainable, scalable, and ready for real-world use.

**First step is always to load the data!**
I will ingest data first; here's how I will do it little differently:
1. Use Design Patterns to handle other sets of data accordingly.
2. Make it readable, and reproducible in that sense.
   
I will make use of Factory Design Pattern.

**Factory Design Pattern**
Imagine I run a coffee shop. Customers can order different types of coffee, but the process of making coffee follows a similar pattern. I have a general coffee-making machine (the factory) that can be used to make different types of coffee (products) like Espresso, Latte, or Cappuccino.
    CoffeeMachine (Factory): Has a method to make coffee.
Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino (ConcreteProducts): Different types of coffee that can be made by the machine.
